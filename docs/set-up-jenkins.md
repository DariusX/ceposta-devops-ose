# Setting up Jenkins for the Continuous Delivery Demo
We use docker containers for all of the continuous deliver pieces, so follow the first section on setting up the
Docker container on your host. Docker isn't required if you wish to manually set up an environment somewhere else.

## Set up Docker container
For this container, we're using an image from the scripts in this project. So you'll need to have this project checked
out into a directory from now on referred to $PROJ_ROOT.
