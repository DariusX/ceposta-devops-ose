# Git
This project holds any misc artifacts that can be used when communicating with the [Gerrit](../docs/set-up-gerrit.md)
server or [Gitlab](../docs/set-up-gitlab.md) installation. 

For now it just holds SSH keys. They aren't required for the demo as we use HTTP authentication to make it easier. In
a real environment, I'd recommend setting up the SSH keys.
